    <h1>5 most stylish footballers</h1>
    <p>
      Even off-pitch these athletes continue to do what they do best - impress
      us with their grail-level fits. Below we present to you the 10 football
      players we think knocked it out of the park with their high-fashion game
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      <h3>1. Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)</h3>
      <p>
        One of the world's greatest football players also happens to be one of
        the most stylish dudes on the planet. And luckily for us, he is
        documenting it all on the 'gram. From how to rock the most basic
        loungewear sets to the most outlandish suits, he's your man.
      </p>

    <br><br>
    <div>
      <h3>2. Kylian Mbappe (France)</h3>
      <p>
        Kylian's unmatched swagger comes from mixing hypebeast items with the
        right basics. Of course, a steady supply of goods from Nike (he's the
        brand ambassador) only helps things further.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      <h3>3. Paul Pogba (France)</h3>
      <p>
        The mercurial midfielder is not afraid to wear flashy logos and make a
        bold statement wherever he goes. Like the Versace pyjamas he wore to
        celebrate Mother's Day with his family at home.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      <h3>4. Memphis Depay (Netherlands)</h3>
      <p>
        Loungewear is the need of the hour. Allow the primo footballer to show
        you how to maintain goal-scoring style for getting some ice cream
        takeaway, running errands and doing a whole lot of nothing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div>
      <h3>5. Serge Gnabry (Germany)</h3>
      <p>
        Not all footballers are swathed in logo-laden outfits. Case in point:
        Serge Gnabry, who has carved out a cool niche for himself with oversized
        fits, pared down accessories and a whole lotta '90s vibe.
