        Arsenal dominate 10-man Tottenham Hotspur in North London derby triumph

      <h3>
        Arsenal deservedly earned the bragging rights in Saturday's North London
        derby with a stellar 3-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates
        Stadium.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Goals from Thomas Partey, Gabriel Jesus and Granit Xhaka propelled Mikel
        Arteta's men to a dominant win on home turf, as the Gunners recovered
        from Harry Kane's equalising penalty to move four points clear at the
        top of the Premier League table. Despite Arsenal's explosive start to
        the game, it was Aaron Ramsdale who was forced into the first meaningful
        save in the 14th minute, as Richarlison beat the Arsenal offside trap
        from a free kick but saw his toe poke from close range saved low by the
        England goalkeeper.

      <h1>Five of the Premier League's greatest North London derbies</h1>
      <span>By Yusuf Kaosarat, Senior Reporter | 5h</span>
      <p>
        North London derby day is upon us, and there is more than just bragging
        rights on the line when Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur meet at the
        Emirates at lunchtime. Both sides have made blistering starts to the new
        campaign under their ever-ambitious coaches, with Mikel Arteta's side
        sitting pretty at the top of the table, with the chance to move out of
        sight of their bitter adversaries. Meanwhile, the third-placed
        Lilywhites will leapfrog Arsenal into first place with all three points
        on rival turf, with Manchester City not in action until they face
        Manchester United in their own derby encounter.

      <h1>
        Mikel Arteta hints at triple Arsenal injury boost for North London derby
      </h1>
      <span>By Yusuf Kaosarat, Senior Reporter | 1d</span>
      <p>
        Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has hinted that Thomas Partey, Oleksandr
        Zinchenko and Kieran Tierney will all be fit for Saturday's North London
        derby with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. Zinchenko was unable
        to join up with the Ukraine squad for the international break due to a
        calf injury, which also ruled him out of the 3-0 win over Brentford
        earlier this month. Meanwhile, Partey was a withdrawal from the Ghana
        squad due to knee discomfort, although the measure was thought to have
        been precautionary more than anything else.
